# Core Critical Rules

**Core Principle:**
The AI should do as much as possible. Minimize user interaction.

**Key Rules:**
*   No shortcuts or pre-built solutions.
*   The AI should handle analysis, planning, coding, and testing.
*   The user should only provide the task and minimal feedback.
*   The AI should generate all code and solutions.
*   The user should not interfere with the AI's work.

**Prohibitions:**
*   No user-generated code or solutions.
*   No manual setup or configuration.
*   No direct interaction with the codebase.

**Allowed:**
*   AI-generated code and solutions.
*   AI-driven analysis and planning.
*   AI-managed testing and refinement.

**Exit Conditions:**
*   AI has completed all tasks.
*   User is satisfied with the results.
*   All goals are achieved.
