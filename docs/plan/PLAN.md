# SecuLite Project Plan (Autonomous Roadmap)

## Current State
- All-in-one security toolkit (ZAP, Semgrep, Trivy) is robust and CI/CD-ready.
- ZAP report persistence is solved with a fallback copy mechanism.
- Roles/rules are streamlined for autonomous, self-improving management.

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Standardize and cross-link all role/rule files.
2. Implement HTML summary report aggregating all scan results.
3. Add notification integration (Slack/Discord/email) for scan completion/failure.
4. Add configurable scan profiles (depth, speed, custom rules).
5. Add auto-fix suggestions for common issues.
6. Add a simple dashboard or status badge for CI/CD.

## Longer-Term Roadmap
- Compliance checks (OWASP Top 10, SLSA, etc.)
- Auto-update rules and tools
- Integration with external vulnerability databases
- Advanced reporting and analytics

## Self-Monitoring
- This plan will be updated after each major change.
