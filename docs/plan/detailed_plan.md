# SecuLite: Detailed Project Plan

## 1. Project Overview & Objectives
SecuLite is a unified, zero-config security workflow for modern development. It automates web, code, and AI security checks using state-of-the-art open-source tools, minimizing setup and maximizing actionable results.

**Objectives:**
- Provide automated, comprehensive security scanning (web, code, dependencies, AI)
- Minimize configuration and user interaction
- Enable easy extension and integration with CI/CD

---

## 2. Tech Stack Selection
- **Shell (Bash):** For automation scripting (cross-platform, simple)
- **OWASP ZAP:** Web vulnerability scanning (industry standard, open-source)
- **Semgrep:** Static code analysis (multi-language, customizable, fast)
- **Trivy:** Dependency and container scanning (SCA, Docker/K8s support)
- **YAML:** For rules/configs (human-readable, widely supported)
- **GitHub Actions/GitLab CI:** For CI/CD integration (ubiquitous, easy to adopt)

**Rationale:**
All tools are open-source, widely adopted, scriptable, and support automation. The stack is modular and extensible for future needs.

## 3. Architecture Overview
```
[Your Codebase]
     |
     v
[security-check.sh]
     |
     +---> [OWASP ZAP] (web vulns)
     +---> [Semgrep] (code, AI, secrets)
     +---> [Trivy] (deps, containers)
     |
     v
[Unified Results & Filtering]
```
- Modular: Add/remove tools as needed
- Extensible: Plug in new scanners or custom rules

---

## 4. Folder & File Structure
- `/rules/` — Semgrep and custom rules
- `/doc/plan/` — Planning docs (`detailed_plan.md`, `task_1.md`, ...)
- `/scripts/` or root — `security-check.sh` automation script
- `.github/workflows/` — GitHub Actions config (optional)
- `.vscode/` — Editor settings
- `README.md`, `LICENSE`

---

## 5. Implementation Phases
1. **Preparation & Planning**
   - Finalize docs, tech stack, and architecture
2. **Project Structure Setup**
   - Create folders, initial files, and configs
3. **Script Development**
   - Implement `security-check.sh` to run all tools and aggregate results
4. **Rule & Config Creation**
   - Add example Semgrep rules, ZAP, and Trivy configs
5. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Provide GitHub Actions/GitLab CI templates
6. **Testing & Validation**
   - Run on sample codebase, validate results
7. **Documentation & Guidelines**
   - Update README, add extension/contribution docs

---

## 6. Task Breakdown & Sequencing
- See `task_1.md`–`task_5.md` for detailed, actionable tasks for each phase

---

## 7. Documentation & Extension Guidelines
- All features, usage, and extension points documented in README
- Guidelines for adding rules, tools, and CI/CD integration

---

## 8. CI/CD & Automation Strategy
- `security-check.sh` is CI/CD friendly
- Example configs for GitHub Actions and GitLab CI
- Results output in terminal and CI logs

---

## 9. Testing & Validation Plan
- Test script and rules on a sample project
- Validate detection of web, code, and AI vulnerabilities
- Ensure results are actionable and deduplicated

---

## 10. Roadmap & Future Work
- [ ] Add more advanced Semgrep rules (AI, LLM, secrets)
- [ ] Unified HTML/JSON reporting
- [ ] Auto-fix suggestions
- [ ] Integration with new LLM security tools
- [ ] Smart deduplication and noise reduction
