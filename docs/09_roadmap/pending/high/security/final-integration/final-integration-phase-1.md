# Final Integration â€“ Phase 1: Orchestrator Validation

## Overview
Verify that the main orchestrator (security-check.sh) properly integrates all 26 security scanning tools. This phase focuses on ensuring all tools are called, have proper configuration, and generate expected output files.

## Objectives
- [ ] Verify all 26 tools are called in the correct order in security-check.sh
- [ ] Confirm each tool has a corresponding processor file in scripts/
- [ ] Validate that all JSON output files are generated in the results directory
- [ ] Check that all tools have proper error handling in the orchestrator
- [ ] Verify environment variable setup for each tool
- [ ] Test tool execution with minimal sample data

## Deliverables
- File: `scripts/security-check.sh` - Verified orchestrator with all 26 tools
- Validation: List of all integrated tools with their configuration paths
- Documentation: Tool execution order and dependencies
- Test Report: Results of minimal scan execution

## Dependencies
- Requires: All 26 tool processor files exist in scripts/
- Blocks: Phase 2 - HTML Report Integration

## Estimated Time
3 hours

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All 26 tools listed and called in orchestrator
- [ ] Each tool has valid configuration file reference
- [ ] All tools generate expected JSON output files
- [ ] Error handling works for each tool
- [ ] Scan completes successfully without critical errors
