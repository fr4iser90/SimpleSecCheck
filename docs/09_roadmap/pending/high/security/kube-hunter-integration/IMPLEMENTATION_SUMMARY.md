## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup ✅
- Installed Kube-hunter in Dockerfile via `pip3 install kube-hunter`
- Created `kube-hunter/config.yaml` with configuration options
- Set up environment variables

### Phase 2: Core Implementation ✅
- Created `scripts/tools/run_kube_hunter.sh` execution script
- Created `scripts/kube_hunter_processor.py` result processor
- Implemented JSON and text report generation
- Integrated LLM connector for AI explanations

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing ✅
- Integrated Kube-hunter into `security-check.sh` orchestrator
- Updated HTML report generation with Kube-hunter section
- Updated visual summary to display Kube-hunter results
- Added Kube-hunter to overall summary and report links

## Key Features

1. **Kube-hunter Installation**: Added to Dockerfile and available in container
2. **Configuration**: YAML configuration file for scan settings
3. **Execution Script**: Automated scanning with JSON and text output
4. **Result Processing**: Parses findings and generates HTML sections
5. **LLM Integration**: AI-powered explanations for security findings
6. **HTML Report Integration**: Visual summary and detailed sections
7. **Severity Handling**: Color-coded findings based on severity (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, INFO)

## Usage

Kube-hunter scans will run automatically during code scans (SCAN_TYPE=code) and will:
1. Perform Kubernetes cluster security scanning
2. Generate JSON and text reports in the results directory
3. Parse findings and integrate into HTML report
4. Provide AI explanations for security vulnerabilities

## Success Criteria Met ✅

- [x] Kube-hunter CLI installed in Docker container
- [x] Kube-hunter configuration file created
- [x] run_kube_hunter.sh script executes successfully
- [x] kube_hunter_processor.py processes results correctly
- [x] HTML report includes Kube-hunter section
- [x] Integration works with security-check.sh
- [x] Visual summary shows Kube-hunter results
- [x] All links to raw reports work

## Notes

- Kube-hunter runs in passive mode by default for safe scanning
- Remote scanning mode is used for network-based testing
- All findings include AI explanations via LLM connector
- Integration follows existing patterns from other security tools

## Next Steps

The Kube-hunter integration is now complete and ready for use. When scanning Kubernetes clusters, Kube-hunter will:
1. Detect security vulnerabilities
2. Categorize findings by severity
3. Provide detailed explanations
4. Integrate results into the main security report

**Task Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - 2025-10-26T00:38:41.000Z
