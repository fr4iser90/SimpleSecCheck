# Kube-hunter Integration â€“ Phase 1: Foundation Setup

## Overview
This phase focuses on installing Kube-hunter, creating configuration files, and setting up the basic environment for Kubernetes penetration testing capabilities.

## Objectives
- [ ] Install Kube-hunter CLI in Docker container
- [ ] Create Kube-hunter configuration directory structure
- [ ] Set up configuration file with basic settings
- [ ] Configure environment variables for Kube-hunter
- [ ] Test Kube-hunter installation

## Deliverables
- File: `Dockerfile` - Add Kube-hunter installation commands
- File: `kube-hunter/config.yaml` - Basic configuration file
- Directory: `kube-hunter/` - Configuration directory
- Environment: Kube-hunter CLI accessible in container

## Dependencies
- Requires: Docker container setup
- Blocks: Phase 2 - Core Implementation

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Update Dockerfile (1 hour)
Add Kube-hunter installation to Dockerfile:
- Install Python 3 and pip dependencies
- Install Kube-hunter via pip or GitHub release
- Add Kube-hunter to PATH if needed
- Set proper permissions

### Step 2: Create Configuration Directory (30 minutes)
- Create `kube-hunter/` directory at project root
- Create `kube-hunter/config.yaml` with basic configuration
- Set up scan types and modes
- Configure output formats

### Step 3: Environment Setup (30 minutes)
- Add Kube-hunter environment variables to Dockerfile
- Set up cluster access parameters
- Configure authentication options
- Test installation in container

## Estimated Time
2 hours

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Kube-hunter CLI is installed and accessible
- [ ] Configuration file exists and is valid
- [ ] Environment variables are set correctly
- [ ] Installation tested successfully in Docker container
- [ ] Command `kube-hunter --help` works

## Notes
- Kube-hunter is a security tool for Kubernetes clusters
- Requires kubectl or direct cluster access
- Should handle both remote and local scanning modes
- Configuration should support different Kubernetes versions
