## Technical Details

### Main Orchestrator Updates (scripts/security-check.sh)
```bash
# Add Snyk environment variables
export SNYK_CONFIG_PATH_IN_CONTAINER="$BASE_PROJECT_DIR/snyk/config.yaml"

# Add Snyk execution section
if [ "$SCAN_TYPE" = "code" ]; then
    # Set environment variables specifically for run_snyk.sh
    log_message "--- Orchestrating Snyk Scan ---"
    export TARGET_PATH="$TARGET_PATH_IN_CONTAINER"
    export RESULTS_DIR="$RESULTS_DIR_IN_CONTAINER"
    # LOG_FILE is exported
    export SNYK_CONFIG_PATH="$SNYK_CONFIG_PATH_IN_CONTAINER"
    if [ -f "$TOOL_SCRIPTS_DIR/run_snyk.sh" ]; then
        log_message "Executing $TOOL_SCRIPTS_DIR/run_snyk.sh..."
        if /bin/bash "$TOOL_SCRIPTS_DIR/run_snyk.sh"; then
            log_message "run_snyk.sh completed successfully (exit code 0)."
        else
            EXIT_CODE=$?
            log_message "[ORCHESTRATOR ERROR] run_snyk.sh failed with exit code $EXIT_CODE."
            OVERALL_SUCCESS=false
        fi
    else
        log_message "[ORCHESTRATOR ERROR] $TOOL_SCRIPTS_DIR/run_snyk.sh not found!"
        OVERALL_SUCCESS=false
    fi
    log_message "--- Snyk Scan Orchestration Finished ---"
else
    log_message "--- Skipping Snyk Scan (Website scan mode) ---"
fi
```

### HTML Report Generator Updates (scripts/generate-html-report.py)
```python
# Add Snyk processor import
import sys
import os
sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
from snyk_processor import process_snyk_results

# Add Snyk processing in report generation
def generate_html_report(results_dir):
    html_parts = []
    
    # ... existing tool processing ...
    
    # Process Snyk results
    try:
        snyk_html = process_snyk_results(results_dir)
        if snyk_html:
            html_parts.append(snyk_html)
            debug("Snyk results processed successfully")
        else:
            debug("No Snyk results to process")
    except Exception as e:
        debug(f"Error processing Snyk results: {e}")
    
    # ... rest of function ...
```

### False Positive Whitelist Updates (conf/fp_whitelist.json)
```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "False positive whitelist for SimpleSecCheck",
  "tools": {
    "snyk": {
      "description": "Snyk dependency vulnerability scanner",
      "patterns": [
        {
          "pattern": ".*test.*",
          "description": "Ignore vulnerabilities in test dependencies",
          "enabled": true
        },
        {
          "pattern": ".*dev.*",
          "description": "Ignore vulnerabilities in development dependencies",
          "enabled": false
        }
      ],
      "vulnerabilities": [
        {
          "id": "SNYK-JS-EXAMPLE-123456",
          "description": "Example vulnerability to ignore",
          "enabled": false
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
