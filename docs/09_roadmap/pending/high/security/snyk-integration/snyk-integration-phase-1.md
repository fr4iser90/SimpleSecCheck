# Snyk Integration – Phase 1: Foundation Setup

## Overview
Set up Snyk CLI installation and configuration for dependency vulnerability scanning in SimpleSecCheck.

## Objectives
- [x] Install Snyk CLI in Docker container
- [x] Create Snyk configuration directory and files
- [x] Set up environment variables for Snyk
- [x] Test Snyk CLI installation

## Deliverables
- File: `Dockerfile` - Updated with Snyk CLI installation
- File: `snyk/config.yaml` - Snyk configuration file
- Directory: `snyk/` - Snyk configuration directory
- Environment: Snyk CLI functional in container

## Dependencies
- Requires: SimpleSecCheck Docker setup
- Blocks: Phase 2 - Core Implementation

## Estimated Time
2 hours

## Success Criteria
- [x] Snyk CLI installed and accessible in Docker container
- [x] Snyk configuration directory created
- [x] Snyk configuration file created with proper settings
- [x] Snyk CLI responds to basic commands
- [x] Environment variables set correctly

## Technical Details

### Dockerfile Updates
```dockerfile
# Install Snyk CLI
RUN npm install -g snyk

# Set Snyk environment variables
ENV SNYK_CONFIG_PATH=/SimpleSecCheck/snyk/config.yaml
```

### Snyk Configuration (snyk/config.yaml)
```yaml
# Snyk Configuration for SimpleSecCheck
version: "1.0"

# Scan settings
scan:
  # Package managers to scan
  package_managers:
    - npm
    - yarn
    - pip
    - maven
    - gradle
    - go
    - composer
  
  # Severity levels to include
  severity_levels:
    - critical
    - high
    - medium
    - low
  
  # Output formats
  output_formats:
    - json
    - text
  
  # Scan depth
  depth: 10
  
  # Include dev dependencies
  include_dev: true
  
  # Fail on vulnerabilities
  fail_on_vulnerabilities: false

# Authentication (if needed)
auth:
  # Snyk token for authenticated scans
  token: ""
  
# Reporting
reporting:
  # Include detailed vulnerability information
  detailed: true
  
  # Include remediation advice
  remediation: true
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Snyk Configuration Path
export SNYK_CONFIG_PATH_IN_CONTAINER="$BASE_PROJECT_DIR/snyk/config.yaml"

# Snyk Home Directory
export SNYK_HOME="/opt/snyk"
```

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Test Snyk CLI installation
snyk --version

# Test Snyk configuration
snyk config

# Test basic scan capability
snyk test --help
```

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Update Dockerfile
1. Add Snyk CLI installation command
2. Add Snyk environment variables
3. Ensure proper permissions

### Step 2: Create Configuration Directory
1. Create `snyk/` directory
2. Create `snyk/config.yaml` file
3. Set proper file permissions

### Step 3: Test Installation
1. Build Docker image
2. Test Snyk CLI functionality
3. Verify configuration loading

### Step 4: Update Documentation
1. Update README with Snyk information
2. Document configuration options
3. Add troubleshooting guide

## Validation Checklist
