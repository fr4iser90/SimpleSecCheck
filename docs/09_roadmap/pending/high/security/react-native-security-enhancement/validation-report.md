# React Native Security Enhancement - Validation Report

## üìã Executive Summary

**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Task Status:** Planning (0% Complete)  
**Validation Status:** ‚úÖ Implementation Plan Valid - Ready for Execution

### Quick Answer to Your Question

**How to run native scanning?**

```bash
# Simple usage - native scanning is automatic!
./run-docker.sh /path/to/your/react-native-project
```

**That's it!** Once this feature is implemented, the system will:
1. Detect if your project is a React Native/Android/iOS app
2. Run the regular code security scans (Semgrep, CodeQL, etc.)
3. **Automatically** run native Android/iOS scanners if detected
4. Include native findings in the HTML report

No special command needed - it just works automatically when you scan a native project.

## üìù Implementation Plan Validation

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (4 hours) - Status: Not Started

**Files to Create:**
1. `scripts/project_detector.py` - Detect React Native/Android/iOS projects
2. Update `scripts/tools/run_codeql.sh` lines 37-43 - Add Kotlin/Swift/Objective-C
3. `scripts/tools/run_android_manifest_scanner.sh` - Android scanner template
4. `scripts/tools/run_ios_plist_scanner.sh` - iOS scanner template

**Validation:** Plan is solid, well-structured, follows existing patterns

### Phase 2: Core Implementation (5 hours) - Status: Not Started

**Files to Create:**
1. Complete `run_android_manifest_scanner.sh` with security checks
2. `scripts/android_manifest_processor.py` - Process Android findings
3. Complete `run_ios_plist_scanner.sh` with security checks
4. `scripts/ios_plist_processor.py` - Process iOS findings

**Security Checks to Implement:**
- Android: Dangerous permissions, cleartext traffic, backup issues, debug mode
- iOS: ATS misconfig, arbitrary loads, keychain issues, debug settings

**Validation:** Technical requirements are clear and appropriate

### Phase 3: Integration & Documentation (3 hours) - Status: Not Started

**Integration Points:**
1. Update `scripts/security-check.sh` - Add project detection and scanner calls
2. Update `scripts/generate-html-report.py` - Add mobile findings section
3. Update `README.md` - Document native scanning

**Integration Example:**
```bash
# In scripts/security-check.sh after existing scanners
if [ "$SCAN_TYPE" = "code" ]; then
    # Detect if project has native components
    IS_NATIVE=$(python3 /SimpleSecCheck/scripts/project_detector.py --target "$TARGET_PATH" --format json | jq -r '.has_native')
    
    if [ "$IS_NATIVE" = "true" ]; then
        # Run Android manifest scanner
        /bin/bash "$TOOL_SCRIPTS_DIR/run_android_manifest_scanner.sh"
        
        # Run iOS plist scanner
        /bin/bash "$TOOL_SCRIPTS_DIR/run_ios_plist_scanner.sh"
    fi
fi
```

**Validation:** Integration approach matches existing patterns perfectly

## üéØ How Native Scanning Will Work

### Current Flow
```bash
./run-docker.sh /path/to/react-native-project
```

### Internal Flow (After Implementation)
1. **Project Detection** - `project_detector.py` checks for:
   - `android/` folder ‚Üí Android project detected
   - `ios/` folder ‚Üí iOS project detected
   - `package.json` with `react-native` ‚Üí React Native detected
   - `AndroidManifest.xml` ‚Üí Android manifest found
   - `Info.plist` ‚Üí iOS plist found

2. **Regular Scans** - Runs as normal:
   - Semgrep (with React Native security rules)
   - CodeQL (with Kotlin/Swift support)
   - Dependency scanning (npm audit)
   - etc.

3. **Native Scans** - If native detected:
   - Android manifest parsing for security issues
   - iOS plist parsing for security issues
   - Mobile-specific vulnerability detection

4. **Report Generation** - Unified HTML report:
   - Regular code findings
   - Mobile-specific findings section
   - All results in one HTML file

### No Special Commands Needed
The beauty of the design is that it's **completely automatic**. Users don't need to know or care about native scanning - they just run their normal scan command and the system handles everything.

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Project Detector Logic
```python
# scripts/project_detector.py structure
{
  "has_android": true/false,
  "has_ios": true/false,
  "is_react_native": true/false,
  "has_native": true/false,
  "android_manifests": ["path/to/AndroidManifest.xml"],
  "ios_plists": ["path/to/Info.plist"]
}
```

### Android Manifest Scanner
- **Input:** `AndroidManifest.xml` files
- **Output:** `results/android-manifest.json`
- **Checks:**
  - Dangerous permissions (INTERNET, CALL_PHONE, SEND_SMS, etc.)
  - Cleartext traffic allowed
  - Backup enabled (data leakage risk)
  - Debug mode in production builds
  - Missing security configurations

### iOS Plist Scanner
- **Input:** `Info.plist` files
- **Output:** `results/ios-plist.json`
- **Checks:**
  - NSAllowsArbitraryLoads (HTTP not blocked)
  - App Transport Security (ATS) misconfig
  - Debug settings in production
  - Insecure URL schemes
  - Keychain sharing issues

2. ‚úÖ Bare React Native app (with native folders)
3. ‚úÖ Android-only project
4. ‚úÖ iOS-only project
5. ‚úÖ Non-native project (should skip native scanners)

## üìù Answers to Your Questions

### Q: How do I run native scanning?

**A:** Once implemented, it's completely automatic:
```bash
./run-docker.sh /path/to/your/react-native-project
```

The system will automatically detect if it's a native project and run the appropriate scanners.

### Q: Do I need special commands or parameters?

**A:** No! The scanning is automatic. Just pass the path to your project like normal. If it contains native components (Android/iOS), those scanners will run automatically.

### Q: Where are the results?

**A:** Same as always - in the `results/` directory:
- `results/[project-name]_[timestamp]/security-summary.html`
- Regular code findings
- **Plus:** Native mobile findings section

### Q: What if my project isn't native?

**A:** Native scanners are skipped. Only regular code scanning runs. No error, no waste of time.

## üéØ Success Criteria

Implementation will be successful when:
- [ ] React Native projects are automatically detected
- [ ] Android manifests are parsed for security issues
- [ ] iOS plists are parsed for security issues
- [ ] Findings appear in HTML report
- [ ] All tests pass (5 test cases above)

## üìå Conclusion

**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready for Implementation

The implementation plan is well-structured, follows existing patterns, and integrates cleanly with the current architecture. The feature will work automatically once implemented - no special commands or parameters needed. Users just run their normal scan and get native mobile security analysis automatically.

**Next Steps:**
1. Start Phase 1 - Create project detector and scanner templates
2. Test project detection with sample apps
3. Proceed through remaining phases
4. End-to-end testing
5. Update documentation

**Estimated Time:** 12 hours total
- Phase 1: 4 hours
- Phase 2: 5 hours  
- Phase 3: 3 hours

**Risk Level:** Low (additive feature, no breaking changes)
