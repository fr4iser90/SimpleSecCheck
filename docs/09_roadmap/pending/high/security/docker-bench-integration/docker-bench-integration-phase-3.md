# Docker Bench Integration – Phase 3: Integration & Testing

## Overview
This phase focuses on integrating Docker Bench into the main security check orchestrator, updating the HTML report generator, and conducting comprehensive testing to ensure the integration works correctly.

## Objectives
- [x] Integrate Docker Bench into security-check.sh
- [x] Update generate-html-report.py to include Docker Bench section
- [x] Test Docker Bench execution in container
- [x] Validate HTML report generation
- [x] Test Docker daemon access and compliance checking
- [x] Document Docker Bench usage

## Deliverables
- Updated: `scripts/security-check.sh` - Docker Bench orchestration section
- Updated: `scripts/generate-html-report.py` - Docker Bench HTML generation
- Updated: `docker-compose.yml` - Docker socket mount configuration
- Testing: Docker Bench integration validation
- Documentation: Docker Bench usage and configuration

## Dependencies
- Requires: Phase 1 completion (installation), Phase 2 completion (script and processor)
- Blocks: Task completion and production readiness

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Update security-check.sh (30 minutes)
Add Docker Bench orchestration to `scripts/security-check.sh`:
- Add DOCKER_BENCH_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
- Create Docker Bench orchestration section (similar to Kube-bench pattern)
- Export environment variables for run_docker_bench.sh
- Add error handling and logging
- Skip for website scan mode (Docker Bench is code/Docker daemon specific)
- Add exit code tracking

### Step 2: Update HTML Report Generator (30 minutes)
Update `scripts/generate-html-report.py`:
- Import docker_bench_processor module
- Add Docker Bench result loading from JSON file
- Generate HTML section using docker_bench_processor
- Add Docker Bench section to report
- Handle missing Docker Bench results gracefully
- Ensure proper HTML escaping for all content

### Step 3: Docker Socket Configuration (15 minutes)
Update `docker-compose.yml` if needed:
- Ensure Docker socket is mounted: `/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`
- Add any required environment variables
- Test Docker socket access in container

### Step 4: Testing & Validation (45 minutes)
- Test Docker Bench script execution with actual Docker daemon
- Test processor with real Docker Bench output
- Test HTML report generation with Docker Bench section
- Test error handling for missing Docker daemon
- Test Docker socket connection validation
- Validate compliance check execution
- Test concurrent execution with other tools

## Estimated Time
2 hours

## Success Criteria
- [x] Docker Bench is integrated into security-check.sh
- [x] HTML report includes Docker Bench section
- [x] All tests pass without errors
- [x] Error handling works for edge cases
- [x] Docker socket access is properly configured
- [x] Compliance checks execute successfully
- [x] Documentation is updated

## ✅ Phase 3 Status: Completed
Completed: 2025-10-26T07:45:07.000Z

## Notes
- Follow existing integration patterns from Kube-bench
- Test with real Docker daemon configuration
- Handle Docker daemon socket permission issues
- Ensure proper error messages for troubleshooting
- Document any Docker-specific configuration requirements

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Docker Bench runs successfully in container
- [x] Processor parses results correctly
- [x] HTML report displays Docker Bench section
- [x] LLM explanations appear in report
- [x] Docker socket access works
- [x] Compliance checks identify issues correctly
- [x] Error handling works for connection failures
- [x] Integration with security-check.sh works
- [x] Logging is comprehensive
- [x] No conflicts with other security tools

## Documentation Updates
- [x] Add Docker Bench to README.md
- [x] Document Docker socket requirements
- [x] Add Docker Bench usage examples
- [x] Document compliance check types
- [x] Add troubleshooting guide for Docker access issues
- [x] Document configuration options
