# Docker Bench Integration – Phase 2: Core Implementation

## Overview
This phase focuses on creating the Docker Bench execution script, result processor, and integrating with the reporting system to generate compliance reports.

## Objectives
- [x] Create Docker Bench execution script
- [x] Create Docker Bench processor for result parsing
- [x] Implement JSON and text report generation
- [x] Integrate with LLM explanation system
- [x] Add Docker daemon compliance results to HTML reports

## Deliverables
- File: `scripts/tools/run_docker_bench.sh` - Docker Bench execution script
- File: `scripts/docker_bench_processor.py` - Docker Bench result processor
- Feature: Docker compliance JSON and text reports
- Feature: LLM explanations for compliance findings
- Feature: HTML report integration

## Dependencies
- Requires: Phase 1 completion (Docker Bench installation and configuration)
- Blocks: Phase 3 - Integration & Testing

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Execution Script (45 minutes)
Create `scripts/tools/run_docker_bench.sh`:
- Set up environment variables (RESULTS_DIR, LOG_FILE, DOCKER_BENCH_CONFIG_PATH)
- Check for Docker Bench script availability
- Execute Docker Bench with JSON and text outputs
- Handle Docker socket connection errors
- Generate compliance reports in results directory
- Log all operations to main log file

### Step 2: Create Result Processor (45 minutes)
Create `scripts/docker_bench_processor.py`:
- Parse Docker Bench JSON output
- Extract compliance findings (pass, warn, fail, note, info)
- Process check groups (host configuration, Docker daemon, Docker containers)
- Generate AI explanations using LLM connector
- Format findings for HTML display
- Handle JSON parsing errors gracefully

### Step 3: LLM Integration (30 minutes)
- Integrate with llm_connector module
- Create prompts for Docker compliance checks
- Generate explanations for each finding
- Handle LLM connection failures
- Cache explanations to avoid duplicate queries

## Estimated Time
2 hours

## Success Criteria
- [x] run_docker_bench.sh executes successfully
- [x] docker_bench_processor.py processes results correctly
- [x] JSON and text reports are generated
- [x] LLM explanations are generated for findings
- [x] Error handling works correctly for edge cases
- [x] All operations are logged properly

## ✅ Phase 2 Status: Completed
Completed: 2025-10-26T07:45:07.000Z

## Notes
- Follow existing processor patterns (kube_bench_processor.py, trivy_processor.py)
- Use existing HTML generation utilities
- Integrate with LLM connector for explanations
- Handle Docker daemon connection errors gracefully
- Support both local and remote Docker daemon access

## Code Patterns to Follow
- Use `tee -a "$LOG_FILE"` for logging in bash scripts
- Use try-except blocks in Python processors
- Use `html.escape()` for HTML output
- Follow naming conventions: docker_bench for processor, run_docker_bench.sh for script
- Use existing environment variable patterns
