# SecuLite v2: Feature Backlog

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
**Status:** In Progress

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

This document serves as the initial, comprehensive list of all desired features, functionalities, and capabilities for the SecuLite v2 platform. It aims to capture the full scope of the project's ambitions. This backlog will be used as a basis for prioritization, release planning, and task breakdown during the development lifecycle.

Items listed here will be further refined into user stories or specific tasks, and prioritized (e.g., Must-Have for MVP, Essential, Nice to Have) in subsequent planning phases.

## 2. Feature Prioritization Key (To Be Defined Later)

To effectively manage the development and release of SecuLite v2, features in this backlog will be assigned a priority level. The following key will be used:

-   **P0 - MVP (Must-Have for Minimum Viable Product)**:
    -   **Description**: These are core, critical features absolutely essential for the first usable and valuable version of SecuLite v2. The product would not achieve its primary objective or be viable for early adopters without these features.
    -   **Focus**: Delivers fundamental value and solves the core problem for the initial target user group.
    -   **Scope**: Kept to the minimum necessary to be functional, learn, and iterate.

-   **P1 - Essential (Post-MVP High Priority)**:
    -   **Description**: Highly important features that significantly enhance the product's value, utility, and completeness. These are typically top candidates for development in the releases immediately following the MVP.
    -   **Focus**: Addresses key secondary needs, improves usability significantly, or completes a core workflow.

-   **P2 - Important (Nice to Have)**:
    -   **Description**: Valuable features that provide additional benefits, convenience, or cover more edge cases, but are not critical for the core functionality defined by P0 and P1.
    -   **Focus**: Enhancements, optimizations, or features catering to a broader set of user needs beyond the initial focus.
    -   **Scope**: Can be scheduled for later releases once P0 and P1 features are stable and well-received.

-   **P3 - Future Consideration**: 
    -   **Description**: Features that are good ideas for the long-term evolution of the platform, may depend on other P0/P1/P2 features being in place, require significant research, or target a much later phase of product maturity.
    -   **Focus**: Strategic long-term capabilities, experimental features, or significant expansions of scope.

Prioritization will be an ongoing process, and these levels may be adjusted as the project progresses and more feedback is gathered.
