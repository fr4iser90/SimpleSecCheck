# SecuLite v2: CI/CD Pipeline Plan

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
**Status:** In Progress

## 1. Overview and Goals

This document outlines the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the SecuLite v2 platform. The primary goals of this CI/CD pipeline are to:

-   **Automate Repetitive Tasks**: Automate the building, testing, and deployment processes to reduce manual effort and ensure consistency.
-   **Improve Code Quality**: Integrate automated checks for linting, code style, and various levels of testing (unit, integration) early in the development cycle.
-   **Enhance Security**: Incorporate automated security scanning (SAST, DAST, dependency checking) to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities proactively.
-   **Faster Release Cycles**: Enable more frequent and reliable releases by streamlining the path from code commit to production deployment.
-   **Increase Reliability**: Reduce the risk of human error in deployment processes and ensure that only tested and validated code reaches production.
-   **Provide Visibility**: Offer clear visibility into the build and deployment status for the development team.

## 2. Chosen CI/CD Platform

**Platform:** GitHub Actions

**Rationale for Choice:**

GitHub Actions has been selected as the CI/CD platform for SecuLite v2 due to the following reasons:

-   **Seamless GitHub Integration**: Being native to GitHub, it offers tight integration with the codebase repositories, pull requests, and other GitHub features, simplifying setup and workflow automation.
-   **Rich Ecosystem and Community**: GitHub Actions boasts a vast marketplace of pre-built actions for a wide array of tasks (e.g., setting up Python/Node.js environments, Docker operations, cloud deployments, security scanning), which can significantly speed up pipeline development.
-   **Cost-Effectiveness**: GitHub Actions provides a generous free tier for public repositories and a considerable amount of free minutes and storage for private repositories, making it suitable for projects of various sizes, including the initial phases of SecuLite v2.
-   **YAML-Based Configuration**: Workflows are defined as YAML files (`.github/workflows/`) stored directly within the repository. This approach promotes version control for pipeline configurations, enhances transparency, and allows for easier review and modification.
-   **Hosted and Self-Hosted Runners**: GitHub provides managed runners for Linux, Windows, and macOS. For more specialized needs, greater control over the environment, or to overcome resource limitations of hosted runners, self-hosted runners can also be configured.
-   **Security Features**: Offers built-in support for managing secrets and tokens securely, which is crucial for CI/CD operations like pushing to container registries or deploying to cloud environments.
-   **Developer Familiarity**: As a widely adopted platform, many developers are already familiar with GitHub Actions, potentially reducing the learning curve for the team.

These factors make GitHub Actions a robust, flexible, and developer-friendly choice for automating the build, test, and deployment processes for SecuLite v2.

## 3. Pipeline Stages

The CI/CD pipeline will consist of several stages, executed sequentially or in parallel where appropriate. Each stage must pass for the pipeline to proceed to the next.

### 3.1. Trigger (Code Commit/Merge)
-   The pipeline is typically triggered by a push to a version control branch (e.g., feature branch, `develop`, `main`) or a merge/pull request event.

### 3.2. Linting and Code Style Checks
-   **Backend (Python/Django)**: Run linters (e.g., Flake8, Pylint) and code formatters (e.g., Black, isort).
-   **Frontend (Vue.js/JavaScript/TypeScript)**: Run linters (e.g., ESLint, Prettier) and formatters.
-   **Goal**: Ensure code consistency, readability, and adherence to style guides.

### 3.3. Unit Tests
-   **Backend**: Execute unit tests using a framework like `pytest` or Django's built-in test runner. Mock external dependencies.
-   **Frontend**: Execute unit tests for components and logic using a framework like Jest or Vitest.
-   **Goal**: Verify individual units of code (functions, classes, components) work as expected.

### 3.4. Integration Tests
-   **Backend**: Test interactions between different components of the backend, including database interactions. May involve setting up a test database.
-   **Frontend**: Test interactions between multiple components, routing, and state management.
-   **API Tests**: Test API endpoints for correct behavior, request/response formats, and authentication/authorization.
-   **Goal**: Ensure different parts of the application work together correctly.

### 3.5. Security Scans
-   **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Analyze source code for potential security vulnerabilities (e.g., using SonarQube, Snyk Code, Bandit for Python).
-   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)**: Scan dependencies (Python packages, npm modules) for known vulnerabilities (e.g., Snyk Open Source, OWASP Dependency-Check, `poetry-check-safety`).
-   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Scanning**: If applicable (e.g., for Dockerfiles, Terraform), scan for misconfigurations.
-   **(Optional) Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**: Run against a deployed instance in a staging/test environment to find vulnerabilities at runtime.
-   **Goal**: Proactively identify and report security weaknesses.

### 3.6. Build Docker Images
-   Build Docker images for the `backend` (which also serves `worker` and `beat`) and potentially a standalone `nginx` image (if the frontend build is part of Nginx image creation as per Section 6 of `05_docker_setup.md`).
-   Tag images appropriately (e.g., with Git commit SHA, branch name, version number).
-   **Goal**: Package the application and its dependencies into runnable container images.

### 3.7. Push Docker Images to Registry
-   Push the built Docker images to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR, Google GCR, GitHub Container Registry).
-   **Goal**: Store images for deployment and versioning.

### 3.8. Deploy to Staging Environment
-   Deploy the new images to a staging environment that mirrors production as closely as possible.
-   Run smoke tests or automated end-to-end tests against the staging environment.
-   Allow for manual QA and review if needed.
-   **Goal**: Validate the application in a production-like setting before deploying to live users.

### 3.9. (Optional) Manual Approval for Production
-   For deployments to production, a manual approval step might be required, especially for `main` branch deployments.
-   **Goal**: Provide a final checkpoint before releasing to production.

### 3.10. Deploy to Production Environment
-   Deploy the validated images to the production environment.
-   Use deployment strategies like blue/green or canary to minimize downtime and risk (if applicable).
-   Monitor the deployment closely.
-   **Goal**: Release new features and fixes to users.

### 3.11. Post-Deployment Monitoring & Rollback
-   Monitor application health, performance, and error rates immediately after deployment.
-   Have a clear rollback plan/mechanism in case the deployment introduces issues.
-   **Goal**: Ensure stability and rapid response to any post-deployment problems.

## 4. Branching Strategy

The following branching strategy will be adopted for SecuLite v2, designed to integrate smoothly with the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline:

1.  **`main` Branch**:
    *   **Purpose**: Represents the current, stable, production-ready codebase. This branch is always deployable.
    *   **Source**: Merges typically come from the `staging` branch after successful validation and QA.
    *   **CI/CD Interaction**:
        *   Merges into `main` (e.g., after a PR from `staging` is approved) trigger the **Production Deployment Pipeline**. This includes:
            *   Running all tests (unit, integration, API, security scans) as a final verification.
            *   Building and tagging final production Docker images.
            *   Pushing images to the production container registry.
            *   (Optional but Recommended) A manual approval step before deployment to the production environment.
            *   Deployment to the production environment.
            *   Post-deployment smoke tests and monitoring initiation.

2.  **`staging` Branch**:
    *   **Purpose**: Serves as an integration and testing ground for features before they are promoted to production. This branch is deployed to a staging environment that mirrors production as closely as possible.
    *   **Source**: Merges come from feature/bugfix/chore branches via Pull Requests.
    *   **CI/CD Interaction**:
        *   Merges into `staging` (after a PR is approved) trigger the **Staging Deployment Pipeline**. This includes:
            *   Running all linting, tests (unit, integration, API), and security scans.
            *   Building Docker images (tagged appropriately for staging).
            *   Pushing images to the container registry (e.g., to a staging repository or with staging tags).
            *   Deployment to the staging environment.
            *   Automated end-to-end tests or smoke tests against the staging environment.

3.  **Feature, Bugfix, Chore Branches (e.g., `feature/name`, `bugfix/issue-123`, `chore/refactor-auth`)**:
    *   **Purpose**: Used by developers to work on new features, fix bugs, or perform other tasks like refactoring. These are typically short-lived.
    *   **Source**: Branched from the latest `staging` branch.
    *   **Target for PRs**: Pull Requests are made from these branches to the `staging` branch.
    *   **CI/CD Interaction**:
        *   **On Push to Branch**: Pushes to these branches automatically trigger a **Validation Pipeline**. This typically includes:
            *   Linting and code style checks.
            *   Unit tests.
            *   (Optional) A subset of faster integration tests or security scans for quick feedback.
        *   **On Pull Request (to `staging`)**: Opening or updating a Pull Request targeting `staging` triggers a more comprehensive **PR Validation Pipeline**. This includes:
            *   Full linting and code style checks.
            *   All unit and integration tests.
            *   All relevant security scans (SAST, SCA).
            *   Building Docker images (to ensure the application can be packaged, but not necessarily pushing them unless needed for review apps).
            *   Merging the PR is typically blocked if any of these checks fail.

**Workflow Summary:**

Developer creates `feature/my-cool-feature` from `staging` -> Makes commits, pushes to remote `feature/my-cool-feature` (triggers validation pipeline) -> Creates PR to `staging` (triggers PR validation pipeline) -> PR reviewed and merged to `staging` (triggers deployment to staging environment) -> After QA on staging, `staging` branch is merged to `main` (e.g., via a PR or direct merge by authorized personnel) -> Merge to `main` triggers deployment to production.

This strategy ensures that code is continuously validated at different stages, with dedicated environments for thorough testing before reaching users.

## 5. Secrets Management in CI/CD

Effective and secure management of secrets is critical for the CI/CD pipeline. Since GitHub Actions is the chosen CI/CD platform, its built-in encrypted secrets feature will be the primary method for handling sensitive information.

**Key Practices:**

1.  **Primary Method: GitHub Actions Encrypted Secrets**:
    *   Sensitive information such as API keys, database passwords, container registry credentials (e.g., `DOCKER_USERNAME`, `DOCKER_PASSWORD`), cloud provider credentials (e.g., `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`), and tokens for third-party services (e.g., `SONAR_TOKEN`) will be stored as encrypted secrets within the GitHub repository or organization settings.
    *   These secrets are encrypted by GitHub and are only exposed to workflow runs that are explicitly configured to access them.
    *   Workflows can access these secrets using the `secrets` context, for example: `${{ secrets.MY_SECRET_NAME }}`.

2.  **Scope of Secrets**:
    *   **Repository Secrets**: Used for secrets specific to this SecuLite v2 repository.
    *   **Organization Secrets** (if applicable): If SecuLite v2 is part of a GitHub organization, secrets that need to be shared across multiple repositories (e.g., common deployment credentials) can be defined at the organization level and made available to selected repositories.
    *   **Environment Secrets**: GitHub Actions also allows defining secrets specific to deployment environments (e.g., `staging`, `production`), providing an additional layer of control. This is highly recommended for environment-specific credentials.

3.  **Access Control**:
    *   The ability to create, update, or delete secrets in GitHub will be restricted to users with administrative privileges on the repository or organization.

4.  **Naming Convention**:
    *   A consistent naming convention will be adopted for secrets, typically uppercase with underscores (e.g., `PROD_DB_PASSWORD`, `STAGING_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`).

5.  **No Hardcoding Secrets**:
    *   Under no circumstances should secrets be hardcoded into workflow files (`.yml`), application source code, or any other files committed to the version control system.

6.  **Review and Rotation**:
    *   Secrets should be periodically reviewed for necessity.
    *   A policy for rotating secrets (especially access keys and passwords) should be established and followed as a security best practice.

7.  **Least Privilege**:
    *   Secrets should be configured with the minimum necessary permissions for the tasks they enable (e.g., a token for pushing to a container registry should only have push rights, not broader administrative rights).

8.  **Alternatives (for future consideration)**:
    *   While GitHub Actions Encrypted Secrets are sufficient for the current scope, if more advanced secret management capabilities are required in the future (e.g., dynamic secrets, complex access control policies, centralized auditing across multiple platforms), integration with dedicated secrets management tools like HashiCorp Vault (using its GitHub Actions integration) or cloud-provider specific solutions (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) could be explored.

By adhering to these practices, we can ensure that sensitive data required by the CI/CD pipeline is managed securely and responsibly.

## 6. Notifications

Timely and relevant notifications are essential for keeping the development team informed about the status of CI/CD pipeline executions, enabling quick responses to failures and awareness of successful deployments.

**Purpose of Notifications:**
-   Inform the team immediately about build and deployment successes or failures.
-   Facilitate rapid investigation and resolution of pipeline issues.
-   Provide visibility into the deployment lifecycle.

**Primary Notification Channels (Leveraging GitHub Actions):**

1.  **Email Notifications (Built-in GitHub Actions Feature)**:
    *   GitHub Actions can automatically send email notifications for workflow run statuses.
    *   By default, emails are often sent to the user who triggered the workflow or users with commit access, particularly for failed runs.
    *   The conditions for these notifications (e.g., on failure, on success, always) can be configured within the workflow YAML files using the `if` conditional with job statuses (e.g., `if: failure()`, `if: success()`).

2.  **Team Chat Integration (e.g., Slack or Microsoft Teams)**:
    *   Dedicated GitHub Actions from the Marketplace will be used to send customized notifications to specific team chat channels.
        *   Example for Slack: `slackapi/slack-github-action`.
        *   Example for Microsoft Teams: A suitable action like `atsign-foundation/actions-teams-notify` or a webhook-based approach.
    *   **Key Events for Chat Notifications**:
        *   Successful deployment to the `staging` environment.
        *   Successful deployment to the `production` environment.
        *   Failed pipeline runs on `main` or `staging` branches.
        *   Failed pipeline runs for Pull Requests targeting `staging`.
        *   (Optional) Critical security scan findings if they exceed a predefined threshold.

**Content of Notifications:**

Notifications should be concise yet informative, typically including:
-   **Repository Name**: SecuLite v2
-   **Branch/Pull Request**: The specific branch or PR number that triggered the workflow.
-   **Commit SHA**: The Git commit hash.
-   **Workflow Status**: Clear indication of success ✅ or failure ❌.
-   **Workflow Name**: The name of the GitHub Actions workflow.
-   **Link to Workflow Run**: A direct URL to the specific workflow run in GitHub Actions for detailed logs and investigation.
-   **For Failures**: The name of the job or step that failed, and if possible, a brief error message snippet.
-   **Triggering User**: The GitHub username of the person who initiated the event (e.g., pushed the commit or merged the PR).

**Configuration:**
-   Notification triggers, conditions, and message formatting will be defined within the GitHub Actions workflow YAML files (`.github/workflows/`).
-   Sensitive information for notification integrations (e.g., Slack/Teams webhook URLs) will be stored as GitHub Actions Encrypted Secrets (as detailed in Section 5).

By implementing this notification strategy, the team will remain well-informed about the CI/CD pipeline's operational status, fostering a proactive approach to development and deployment.
