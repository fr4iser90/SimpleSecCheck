# SecuLite v2: CI/CD Pipeline Plan

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
**Status:** In Progress

## 1. Overview and Goals

This document outlines the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the SecuLite v2 platform. The primary goals of this CI/CD pipeline are to:

-   **Automate Repetitive Tasks**: Automate the building, testing, and deployment processes to reduce manual effort and ensure consistency.
-   **Improve Code Quality**: Integrate automated checks for linting, code style, and various levels of testing (unit, integration) early in the development cycle.
-   **Enhance Security**: Incorporate automated security scanning (SAST, DAST, dependency checking) to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities proactively.
-   **Faster Release Cycles**: Enable more frequent and reliable releases by streamlining the path from code commit to production deployment.
-   **Increase Reliability**: Reduce the risk of human error in deployment processes and ensure that only tested and validated code reaches production.
-   **Provide Visibility**: Offer clear visibility into the build and deployment status for the development team.

## 2. Chosen CI/CD Platform

**Platform:** GitHub Actions

**Rationale for Choice:**

GitHub Actions has been selected as the CI/CD platform for SecuLite v2 due to the following reasons:

-   **Seamless GitHub Integration**: Being native to GitHub, it offers tight integration with the codebase repositories, pull requests, and other GitHub features, simplifying setup and workflow automation.
-   **Rich Ecosystem and Community**: GitHub Actions boasts a vast marketplace of pre-built actions for a wide array of tasks (e.g., setting up Python/Node.js environments, Docker operations, cloud deployments, security scanning), which can significantly speed up pipeline development.
-   **Cost-Effectiveness**: GitHub Actions provides a generous free tier for public repositories and a considerable amount of free minutes and storage for private repositories, making it suitable for projects of various sizes, including the initial phases of SecuLite v2.
-   **YAML-Based Configuration**: Workflows are defined as YAML files (`.github/workflows/`) stored directly within the repository. This approach promotes version control for pipeline configurations, enhances transparency, and allows for easier review and modification.
-   **Hosted and Self-Hosted Runners**: GitHub provides managed runners for Linux, Windows, and macOS. For more specialized needs, greater control over the environment, or to overcome resource limitations of hosted runners, self-hosted runners can also be configured.
-   **Security Features**: Offers built-in support for managing secrets and tokens securely, which is crucial for CI/CD operations like pushing to container registries or deploying to cloud environments.
-   **Developer Familiarity**: As a widely adopted platform, many developers are already familiar with GitHub Actions, potentially reducing the learning curve for the team.

These factors make GitHub Actions a robust, flexible, and developer-friendly choice for automating the build, test, and deployment processes for SecuLite v2.

## 3. Pipeline Stages

The CI/CD pipeline will consist of several stages, executed sequentially or in parallel where appropriate. Each stage must pass for the pipeline to proceed to the next.

### 3.1. Trigger (Code Commit/Merge)
-   The pipeline is typically triggered by a push to a version control branch (e.g., feature branch, `develop`, `main`) or a merge/pull request event.

### 3.2. Linting and Code Style Checks
-   **Backend (Python/Django)**: Run linters (e.g., Flake8, Pylint) and code formatters (e.g., Black, isort).
-   **Frontend (Vue.js/JavaScript/TypeScript)**: Run linters (e.g., ESLint, Prettier) and formatters.
-   **Goal**: Ensure code consistency, readability, and adherence to style guides.

### 3.3. Unit Tests
-   **Backend**: Execute unit tests using a framework like `pytest` or Django's built-in test runner. Mock external dependencies.
-   **Frontend**: Execute unit tests for components and logic using a framework like Jest or Vitest.
-   **Goal**: Verify individual units of code (functions, classes, components) work as expected.

### 3.4. Integration Tests
-   **Backend**: Test interactions between different components of the backend, including database interactions. May involve setting up a test database.
-   **Frontend**: Test interactions between multiple components, routing, and state management.
-   **API Tests**: Test API endpoints for correct behavior, request/response formats, and authentication/authorization.
-   **Goal**: Ensure different parts of the application work together correctly.

### 3.5. Security Scans
-   **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Analyze source code for potential security vulnerabilities (e.g., using SonarQube, Snyk Code, Bandit for Python).
-   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)**: Scan dependencies (Python packages, npm modules) for known vulnerabilities (e.g., Snyk Open Source, OWASP Dependency-Check, `poetry-check-safety`).
-   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Scanning**: If applicable (e.g., for Dockerfiles, Terraform), scan for misconfigurations.
-   **(Optional) Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**: Run against a deployed instance in a staging/test environment to find vulnerabilities at runtime.
-   **Goal**: Proactively identify and report security weaknesses.

### 3.6. Build Docker Images
-   Build Docker images for the `backend` (which also serves `worker` and `beat`) and potentially a standalone `nginx` image (if the frontend build is part of Nginx image creation as per Section 6 of `05_docker_setup.md`).
-   Tag images appropriately (e.g., with Git commit SHA, branch name, version number).
-   **Goal**: Package the application and its dependencies into runnable container images.

### 3.7. Push Docker Images to Registry
-   Push the built Docker images to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR, Google GCR, GitHub Container Registry).
-   **Goal**: Store images for deployment and versioning.

### 3.8. Deploy to Staging Environment
-   Deploy the new images to a staging environment that mirrors production as closely as possible.
-   Run smoke tests or automated end-to-end tests against the staging environment.
-   Allow for manual QA and review if needed.
-   **Goal**: Validate the application in a production-like setting before deploying to live users.

### 3.9. (Optional) Manual Approval for Production
-   For deployments to production, a manual approval step might be required, especially for `main` branch deployments.
-   **Goal**: Provide a final checkpoint before releasing to production.

### 3.10. Deploy to Production Environment
-   Deploy the validated images to the production environment.
-   Use deployment strategies like blue/green or canary to minimize downtime and risk (if applicable).
-   Monitor the deployment closely.
-   **Goal**: Release new features and fixes to users.

### 3.11. Post-Deployment Monitoring & Rollback
-   Monitor application health, performance, and error rates immediately after deployment.
-   Have a clear rollback plan/mechanism in case the deployment introduces issues.
-   **Goal**: Ensure stability and rapid response to any post-deployment problems.

## 4. Branching Strategy

The following branching strategy will be adopted for SecuLite v2, designed to integrate smoothly with the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline:

1.  **`main` Branch**:
    *   **Purpose**: Represents the current, stable, production-ready codebase. This branch is always deployable.
    *   **Source**: Merges typically come from the `staging` branch after successful validation and QA.
    *   **CI/CD Interaction**:
        *   Merges into `main` (e.g., after a PR from `staging` is approved) trigger the **Production Deployment Pipeline**. This includes:
            *   Running all tests (unit, integration, API, security scans) as a final verification.
            *   Building and tagging final production Docker images.
            *   Pushing images to the production container registry.
            *   (Optional but Recommended) A manual approval step before deployment to the production environment.
            *   Deployment to the production environment.
            *   Post-deployment smoke tests and monitoring initiation.

2.  **`staging` Branch**:
    *   **Purpose**: Serves as an integration and testing ground for features before they are promoted to production. This branch is deployed to a staging environment that mirrors production as closely as possible.
    *   **Source**: Merges come from feature/bugfix/chore branches via Pull Requests.
    *   **CI/CD Interaction**:
        *   Merges into `staging` (after a PR is approved) trigger the **Staging Deployment Pipeline**. This includes:
            *   Running all linting, tests (unit, integration, API), and security scans.
            *   Building Docker images (tagged appropriately for staging).
            *   Pushing images to the container registry (e.g., to a staging repository or with staging tags).
            *   Deployment to the staging environment.
            *   Automated end-to-end tests or smoke tests against the staging environment.

3.  **Feature, Bugfix, Chore Branches (e.g., `feature/name`, `bugfix/issue-123`, `chore/refactor-auth`)**:
    *   **Purpose**: Used by developers to work on new features, fix bugs, or perform other tasks like refactoring. These are typically short-lived.
    *   **Source**: Branched from the latest `staging` branch.
    *   **Target for PRs**: Pull Requests are made from these branches to the `staging` branch.
    *   **CI/CD Interaction**:
        *   **On Push to Branch**: Pushes to these branches automatically trigger a **Validation Pipeline**. This typically includes:
            *   Linting and code style checks.
            *   Unit tests.
            *   (Optional) A subset of faster integration tests or security scans for quick feedback.
        *   **On Pull Request (to `staging`)**: Opening or updating a Pull Request targeting `staging` triggers a more comprehensive **PR Validation Pipeline**. This includes:
            *   Full linting and code style checks.
            *   All unit and integration tests.
            *   All relevant security scans (SAST, SCA).
            *   Building Docker images (to ensure the application can be packaged, but not necessarily pushing them unless needed for review apps).
            *   Merging the PR is typically blocked if any of these checks fail.

**Workflow Summary:**

Developer creates `feature/my-cool-feature` from `staging` -> Makes commits, pushes to remote `feature/my-cool-feature` (triggers validation pipeline) -> Creates PR to `staging` (triggers PR validation pipeline) -> PR reviewed and merged to `staging` (triggers deployment to staging environment) -> After QA on staging, `staging` branch is merged to `main` (e.g., via a PR or direct merge by authorized personnel) -> Merge to `main` triggers deployment to production.

This strategy ensures that code is continuously validated at different stages, with dedicated environments for thorough testing before reaching users.
