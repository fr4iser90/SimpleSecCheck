## ⚖️ Legal Notice

**Important:** SimpleSecCheck performs active security scans. Ensure you have proper authorization before scanning any target.

### 🌍 Europe (GDPR/DSGVO)

**Germany:**
- ✅ Scanning your own systems/domains is legal
- ✅ Authorized targets with written consent (e.g., contracted pen-testing)
- ❌ Unauthorized scanning violates German law (§202a, §202b, §202c StGB - Data Protection Act)

**EU General (GDPR):**
- Requires explicit consent for automated vulnerability scanning
- May involve processing of personal data
- Ensure compliance with GDPR Article 6 (lawful basis for processing)

### 🇺🇸 United States

**Federal Law (CFAA):**
- Unauthorized access to computer systems is illegal (18 U.S.C. § 1030)
- Scanning systems without permission may constitute a felony
- Legal only with explicit written authorization or ownership

**State Variations:**
- Some states have additional cybercrime laws
- Always obtain written authorization before scanning third-party systems

### 🌐 General Best Practices

**Always Legal:**
- ✅ Your own systems/domains
- ✅ Systems you explicitly own or control

**Requires Authorization:**
- ✅ Contracted penetration testing
- ✅ Bug bounty programs (follow program rules)
- ✅ Staging/test environments (verify ownership/authorization)

**Never Scan Without Permission:**
- ❌ Third-party systems without explicit consent
- ❌ Public websites/applications you don't own
- ❌ Systems outside bug bounty scope

**⚠️ Disclaimer:** This tool is for authorized security testing only. Users are responsible for ensuring they have proper authorization before scanning any system. Unauthorized scanning is illegal and may result in criminal prosecution.

---

## 🏁 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Target codebase or web application to scan

### Easy Usage

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fr4iser90/SimpleSecCheck.git
cd SimpleSecCheck

# Make the script executable (one-time setup)
chmod +x run-docker.sh

# Scan a local code project
./run-docker.sh /path/to/your/project

# Scan a website
./run-docker.sh https://example.com
```

That's it! Results will be available in the `results/` directory.

### Scan Examples

#### 🌐 Website/Domain Scanning
Scan any public website or application:
```bash
./run-docker.sh https://example.com
```

#### 💻 Local Codebase Scanning
Scan your local project for security issues:
```bash
./run-docker.sh /path/to/your/project
```

#### 🏠 Local Network Scanning
Scan applications in your local Docker network (e.g., `http://host.docker.internal:8000`):
```bash
./run-docker.sh network
```

### What Gets Scanned

**Code Projects:**
- Static code analysis with Semgrep
- Dependency vulnerabilities with Trivy
- Security rule violations
- Docker daemon compliance with Docker Bench

**Websites:**
- Web application vulnerabilities with OWASP ZAP
- Security misconfigurations
- Common web attacks

## ⚙️ Configuration (Optional)

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file for custom settings:

```bash
# For web scanning
TARGET_URL=https://your-website.com

# For code scanning (default: auto-detected)
SCAN_TYPE=code
```

### API Tokens (Optional)

Some tools can benefit from API tokens for enhanced functionality:

**Copy the example file and add your tokens:**
```bash
cp env.example .env
nano .env  # Or use your favorite editor
```

**Available API Tokens:**

| Token | Tool | Purpose | Get it from |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `NVD_API_KEY` | OWASP Dependency Check | Higher rate limits for vulnerability database lookups | https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key |
| `SNYK_TOKEN` | Snyk | Cloud-based vulnerability scanning with Snyk | https://snyk.io/user/api |

**Note:** All API tokens are optional. Tools will work in their basic modes without tokens. Tokens are stored locally in your `.env` file (which is git-ignored) and are never uploaded or shared.

## 🛡️ Security Rules

SimpleSecCheck includes comprehensive security rules:

- **Code Bugs** (`rules/code-bugs.yml`) - Common programming errors
- **Secrets Detection** (`rules/secrets.yml`) - API keys, passwords, tokens
- **API Security** (`rules/api-security.yml`) - API vulnerabilities
- **LLM/AI Security** (`rules/llm-ai-security.yml`) - AI-specific vulnerabilities
- **Prompt Injection** (`rules/prompt-injection.yml`) - LLM prompt attacks

---

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Custom Rule Sets

Add your own Semgrep rules to the `rules/` directory:

```bash
# Add custom rules
echo "rules:" >> rules/custom.yml
echo "  - id: my-custom-rule" >> rules/custom.yml
echo "    patterns:" >> rules/custom.yml
echo "      - pattern: dangerous_function(...)" >> rules/custom.yml
```

### Direct Docker Compose Usage

For advanced users who want more control:

```bash
# Code scan with custom settings
docker-compose run --rm -v /path/to/code:/target:ro scanner

# Web scan with custom URL
TARGET_URL=https://your-site.com docker-compose run --rm scanner
```

---

## 🚨 Security Considerations

- **Single-Shot Execution:** No persistent services or monitoring
- **Isolated Environment:** Docker containers are destroyed after scanning
- **Read-Only Access:** Target code is mounted read-only
- **No Data Retention:** All scan data is temporary and local
- **Minimal Attack Surface:** No web interfaces or persistent processes
